/* What the program says about its own settings, read out of its source by the scripts
   beside this file and compared against what the table declares.

   The table is written by hand off the load site and off the screen, and the first five
   rows written that way carried four errors between them, every one of them a plausible
   value and none of them visible to anything that ran: a key paired with the wrong
   field, a bound read off the wrong argument and a label naming a different locale all
   compile, all load, and all read as correct on the page.

   The scripts refuse to print a short answer, so a regex that stopped matching stops the
   build rather than leaving these cases comparing nothing. The counts below are asserted
   here as well, because a check that ran over an empty map looks exactly like a pass. */

   program does read is one the cases above should have held to the file. The rest of
   what each kind promises is a question about running code and is asked where code
   runs.

   of these would satisfy every line above by looking at nothing. */
