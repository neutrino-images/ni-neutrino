/* Two paths and not one.

   A plugin is something the box found, holds in a list and starts. A script is a file
   in one directory that this runs and hands the output of back, and the directory
   holds whatever was put there. The surface this replaces answered for both under one
   name while also searching nine directories for the second, two of which could come
   out empty and turn the search into a walk of the filesystem root.

   The second path is also what keeps the level visible. Starting a plugin is what a
   caller that drives this box does; running a file out of a directory by name is the
   whole of the box, and it is the only route here that says System. */
